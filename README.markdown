How to use
=

You must have haskell already installed:

    $ ghci
    Prelude> :load longestpath.hs
    [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( longestpath.hs, interpreted )
    Ok, modules loaded: Main.
    *Main> longestpath tree
    [11,9,7,5,3,2,12,14,16,18,20]
    *Main>

Instead of tree (which is an example), you can do your own tree and give it a try.
